When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	So that ohter can contribute or share the code .

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	fork- clone other remote repository to mine remote repository(GitHub)
	clone - to clone (rempte or local)repository
	braches - to start anoher brach in master brach (for experimental or adding another features)

	fork we use to directly clone from other gitHub account to your account so that you can make changes in it.
