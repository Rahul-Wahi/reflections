What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	.git directory is createdcontaining the metadata of commited files.
	To commit the files at different point of time so that we recover to
	any version we want.

	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
       It is intermidiate between working directory and repository.Any changes we make in file ,first we have to add that files
       in staging area and than commit them to store the meta data in repositoy. 


	How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	   If one logical change involve multiple files than we can add that files into
	   staging area and than commit them.

	What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	
		When you need to experiment with you code but not sure about this(it will work or not) so you make extra branch for this.
		Make changes in this branch.Also you can continue updating you code in master branch and later on
		you can merge the experimental code(if working fine) with updated master branch code.   

	How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
		Diagram will show the at what points we add new branch.Also any unreachable node by git log can be shown in this diagram.
		
	What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
		All the changes made in both the branches will combined into single version.
		We represent it in diagram to get the better view of branch structure
