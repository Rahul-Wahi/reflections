How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It will shows the lines which are different in two versions and we can check for bugs in those lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can switch back to any version very easily and also if i made any mistake in new version , i can compare it with pervious version for debugging.  

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros : wn can commit any time we wnat, we can commit logically related changes in one single commit
    cons : we have take care of if commmit is not too big(difficult track the changes) or too small(long history of files) 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because when you made some change it may affect multiple files so Git allows saving multiple files in one commit.
